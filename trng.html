        <b>Abstract:</b> Random numbers play a vital role in cryptography and
        secure communications. This project investigates a new approach to the
        generation of high-quality random numbers by combining two different
        sources of entropy: acoustic noise and ambient light signals. While
        various studies have been done on separate entropy sources, there hasn't
        been much research done on using naturally occurring optical and
        acoustic events together to generate random numbers.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        This project proposes a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) system that
        captures acoustic noise and ambient light fluctuations from the
        environment simultaneously. The proposed system will digitize these
        signals and employ a custom algorithm to efficiently merge their
        inherent randomness. This dual-source TRNG will be thoroughly tested
        using standard statistical tests and its performance will be compared
        against single-source TRNGs and conventional Pseudo-Random Number
        Generators (PRNGs).
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Contributing to the field of cryptography hardware, a unique TRNG
        architecture that optimizes random number quality is introduced in this
        research. The findings can be implemented to improve the security of
        cryptographic systems and discover applications in several fields
        requiring high-quality randomness.
